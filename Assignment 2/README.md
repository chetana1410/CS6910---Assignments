# CS6910---Assignments
This repository contains the following files -
* `Part A` - This folder contains the following: 
  * `Q1.py` - This contains the code for CNN model consisting of 5 convolution layers. It further has the code to use the sweep feature in wandb to find the best hyperparameter configuration.
  * `Q4, 5.py` - This contains the code for:
    *  plotting a 10 x 3 grid containing sample images from the test data and predictions made by our best model
    *  Visualising all the filters in the first layer of our best model for a random image from the test set.
    *  implementing guided back propagation on any 10 neurons in the CONV5 layer and plotting the images which excite this neuron.
